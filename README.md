## Security

- The program creates a backup of the original file before making changes
- Checks VDF structure integrity
- Handles file read/write errors

## File Structure

The program works with the `~/.local/share/Steam/config/loginusers.vdf` file, which has the following structure:

```vdf
"users"
{
    "USER_ID"
    {
        "AccountName"       "username"
        "PersonaName"       "Display Name"
        "RememberPassword"  "1"
        "WantsOfflineMode"  "0"  // <- This value is changed
        "SkipOfflineModeWarning" "0"
        "AllowAutoLogin"    "1"
        "MostRecent"        "1"
        "Timestamp"         "1234567890"
    }
}
```

## Support

If you encounter problems, create an issue in the repository or check:

1. Is Steam installed
2. Does the file `~/.local/share/Steam/config/loginusers.vdf` exist
3. Do you have read/write permissions for the file
